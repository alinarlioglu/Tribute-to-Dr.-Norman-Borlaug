            <h3>Who is he?</h3>
            <p>
                Dr. Norman Borlaug was a peaceful revolutionary who spearheaded 'The Green Revolution' movement.
                The Green Revolution is a time in history where humanity overcame a disastrous crisis that would've
                led to starvation and malnutrition for approximately a billion people. The cause of the disaster was
                due to rapidly rising populations as technology and healthcare improved allowing a longer life expectancy
                and lower infant mortality rate. The Green Revolution helped to mechanise farming, introduced genetically
                modified seeds that were resistant to diseases, 
                upgraded soil quality and growing conditions of crops. This led to increased crop yield due to
                discovery of improved pesticides, faster growing crops and improved farming techniques. It was due
                to Dr. Norman Borlaug and his team's effort that humanity was victorious in the fight against 
                starvation.
            </p>
            <h3>Effects of The Green Revolution</h3>
            <p>
                The Green Revolution has had many positive effects on humanity and food crisis prevention. Better infrastructure
                was made available in rural areas, thus farmers could access domestic and international markets much easier
                allowing a positive effect on starvation prevention. Also, facilities was made easier for farmers to access to 
                borrow money to allow a larger profitable harvest, thus contributing in prevention of the food crisis as well as 
                allowing farmers a larger spending power, so they can invest in potentially larger areas of land to farm. This
                helped to make food easier available to the public. Furthermore, large corporations started rapidly producing 
                genetically modified seeds improving crop yields and seeds more resistant to diseases. In addition, mechanical farming
                such as fertilisers, pesticides and new farming techniques like irrigation, allowed faster growth of crops and 
                the expansion of farmers wealth allowing a re-investment to more land for farming. 
            </p>
            <h3>Consequences of The Green Revolution</h3>
            <p>
                The Green Revolution had devastating effects on the environment especially clean water levels as seen from Northern
                and Eastern India's rapidly decreasing water levels due to intense extraction for crop irrigation. This has had negative 
                effects on farmers' livelihoods as they can't provide for themselves as well as make a profit due to low water levels. Thus,
                poverty has potentially increased in these areas due to less spending power. Another effect is the destruction of the culture
                of subsistence farming as The Green Revolution went full-on throttle. This can mean an erosion of a unique culture and an integration
                of different cultures due to globalisation being involved in The Green Revolution.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa.</li>
                    <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                    <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
                    <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                    <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                    <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                    <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
                    <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                    <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                    <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
                    <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                    <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
                    <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
                    <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                    <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
